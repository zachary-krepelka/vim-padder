INTRODUCTION - 1                                              *vim-padder-intro*

Vim Padder is a plugin for padding lines with characters up to a fixed width.
For example, consider the dot leaders in the table of contents just above.

Use your favorite plugin manager for installation.

================================================================================

USAGE - 2                                                     *vim-padder-usage*

2.1 OPERATORS~

This plugin provides two overarching operators, namely `z<` and `z>`.  The angle
brackets indicate direction.  Keep this in mind as you read on.

        2.1.1 THE CONTRACTION OPERATORS~

	A family of operators for contracting whitepace.

                                                                            *z<*
		z<{motion}

			Collapse trailing whitespace on the lines moved over by
			{motion}.  This operator only knows |linewise| motions.
			A [count] is also viable.

		{Visual}z<

			Collapse trailing whitespace on lines in {Visual}.
			Here {Visual} is |linewise-visual|.
                                                                           *z<<*
		z<<

			Apply |z<| with the |_| motion.  In effect, this applies
			|z<| to a single line.

        2.1.2 THE EXPANSION OPERATORS~

	A family of operators for expanding whitespace -- and other characters.

                                                                            *z>*
		z>{motion}

			Pad the lines moved over by {motion} with spaces up to
			the longest of those lines.  This operator only knows
			|linewise| motions.  A [count] is also viable.

		{Visual}z>

			Pad lines with spaces in a |linewise-visual|.

                                                                           *z>>*
		z>>{char}{motion}

			Apply |z>| with a character of your choice.

			That is, pad lines moved over by {motion} with {char} up
			to the longest of those lines.  This operator only knows
			|linewise| motions.  A [count] is also viable.

	2.1.3 A SPECIAL FEATURE~

	The expansion operators exhibit a special functionality.  *1z>* *1z>>*

	As far as I know, it's redundant to prefix Vim's operators with the
	number one since all operators are implicitly enacted one time when
	applied without a count.  In light of this, I have repurposed the number
	one as a flag.  Namely, when a [count] of one is explicitly applied,
	i.e., issuing |1z>| as apposed to just |z>|, a single-character prompt
	will appear in the bottom of the screen.  The inputted string is then
	appended to the end of every padded line moved over by {motion}.

	The most intricate situation that can happen is this.

		1z>>{char}{motion}{prompt}<Enter>

	This pads the lines moved over by {motion} with {char} up to the longest
	of those lines, whereafter it appends the string {prompt} to each line.

	2.1.4 ONE FINAL REMARK~

	By default, both families of operators update the visual selection in
	memory to reflect {motion}.  That selection is then accessible via |gv|.
	Also, both operators move the cursor.  These two behaviors can be
	disabled.  See |vim-padder-customization|.

2.2 COMMANDS~

Three commands are provided.

                                                                       *:Crunch*
	:[range]Crunch

			Collapse trailing whitespace on lines in [range].

				The default [range] is the whole buffer.

                                                                         *:Bang*
	:[range]Bang [N] [char] [start] [end]

			Pad lines in [range] with [char] up to the [N]th column
			wherein the stings [start] and [end] prefix and suffix
			the padding respectively.  The affixes are applied after
			counting columns.

			Every aforementioned argument is optional and assumes a
			default value.  The arguments are positional.  If the
			default value should be assumed, pass |v:none| for that
			argument.  The defaults are as follows.

				[range] --> whole buffer
				[N]     --> length of longest line in [range]
				[char]  --> space
				[start] --> empty string
				[end]   --> empty string

                                                                       *:Bounce*
	:[range]Bounce {n}

			Apply the commands |:Crunch| and |:Bang| in succession
			over the same [range] while passing {n} with all other
			values default.

				The default [range] is the whole buffer.

			Imagine a circumstance in which `:Bang X` is followed by
			`:Bang Y` but X > Y.  This would fail to accomplish the
			desired affect.  The |:Bounce| command resolves this.

2.3 REMARK -- THE ULTIMATE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE~

The aforementioned commands allude to cosmological theories about the end of the
universe.  I have carefully chosen their names to serve as mnemonics.

	- |:Crunch| contracts whitespace
	- |:Bang| expands whitespace
	- |:Bounce| does both

EXAMPLES - 3                                               *vim-padder-examples*

3.1 BASIC OVERVIEW~

Consider the two following imagines.  The dollar sign denotes the end of a line.
>
               A       .  $                 B       .          $
                      ,O,  $                       ,O,         $
                     ,OOO,  $                     ,OOO,        $
               'oooooOOOOOooooo'  $         'oooooOOOOOooooo'  $
                 `OOOOOOOOOOO`  $             `OOOOOOOOOOO`    $
                   `OOOOOOO`  $                 `OOOOOOO`      $
                   OOOO'OOOO  $                 OOOO'OOOO      $
                  OOO'   'OOO  $               OOO'   'OOO     $
                 O'         'O  $             O'         'O    $

With this plugin, you can go from `A` to `B` and back again with ease.

	- To go from `B` to `A`, you would use |z<| or |:Crunch|.

	- To go from `A` to `B`, you would use |z>| or |:Bang|.

3.2 SPECIFIC USE CASES~

Here are some practical examples.

- Use `ggz>G` to pad a buffer with whitespace up to its longest line.

	- This is useful in conjunction with |r|, |R|, and |CTRL-V| for creating
	  ascii-art diagrams.  The cursor becomes free-floating.

	- `:Bang` would also suffice, but you may prefer `:Bang 80`

- Use `ggz<G` to remove all trailing whitespace from a buffer.

	- This is useful for source code cleanliness.

		- https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/121555

	- `:Crunch` would also suffice.

- Use `1z>ip = <Enter>` when writing variable declaration blocks.

	Before: >

		bool flag
		int short_var_name
		string long_variable_name

<
	After: >

		bool flag                  =  false
		int short_var_name         =  42
		string long_variable_name  =  "Hello, World!"
<
	In the right circumstances, this can enhance code readability.

3.3 AN EXTENDED EXAMPLE~

As alluded to in the introduction, we will see how to make a table of contents.
Let's start out with a basic list.  You'll have to copy the following block into
a new buffer if you want to follow along.  Place your cursor anywhere inside the
block and issue the command `vip` to visually select it. >

	1. Introduction
	2. Usage
	3. Example

The command `:'<,'>Bang 50 .` would already suffice, but >

	:'<,'>Bang 50 . \ \ \  \ \ \ |some-plugin-

gives a cleaner appearence with little extra work. >

	1. Introduction   ...........................   |some-plugin-
	2. Usage   ..................................   |some-plugin-
	3. Example   ................................   |some-plugin-

We're essentially doing `Bang 50 . ___ ___|`, but we have to escape the spaces.

The normal-mode command `1z>>.ip|some-plugin-<Enter>` is a close match.

================================================================================

SOLUTION - 5                                               *vim-padder-solution*

Put your cursor anywhere inside the box.

You could first try >

	z>ipgv:'<,'>norm A|<Enter>

but it would be quicker to do >

	1z>ip|<Enter>

Remember, you're not limited to just one-character at the end. >

	1z>ip| <3<Enter>

Bonus: try to use a different character for the padding.

================================================================================

CUSTOMIZATION - 6                                     *vim-padder-customization*

Customization is achieved by setting variables in your |.vimrc| file.

*g:padder_updates_visual*	(default: 1)

	By default, this plugin's operators update the visual selection in
	memory to reflect the motion enacted with them.  That selection is then
	accessible via |gv|.  To preserve the last visual selection, put this in
	your |.vimrc| file. >

		let g:padder_updates_visual = 0

*g:padder_moves_cursor*	(default: 1)

	By default, the motions applied to this plugin's operators move the
	cursor.  Add this in your |.vimrc| file to fix the cursor in place. >

		let g:padder_moves_cursor = 0

*g:padder_clusivity*	(default: 1)

	When padding lines, the [N]th column may be either included or excluded.
	It is by default included.  To exclude the [N]th column, put this in
	your |.vimrc| file. >

		let g:padder_clusivity = 0
<
	Note that clusivity is a hypernym of inclusively and exclusivity.

7.1 Inspirations~

I initially wrote two functions in my |.vimrc|.

	- Flatten(), mapped to <leader>f
	- Boxify(),  mapped to <leader>b

My need for them arose while authoring LaTeX documents.  After a while, I wanted
something more versatile, something that would work with motions.  I decided to
adapt this functionality into a plugin to share with other people.
